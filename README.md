# SquadUP
An intuitive video game matchmaking system featuring Discord integration, which was hosted on Heroku for our presentation in the COP4331C at the University of Central Florida. Created using the MERN Stack and related development principles. 
Built by Michael Miller (full stack, Discord integration), Leo Alepuz (API), Elias Cousino (frontend), Reece Segui (API), Cesar Hernandez (Database), and Alex Zommer (Mobile app).

## Why Did We Develop This?
Our team was instructed to build and deploy any app idea we wanted for the second project of this course. With this in mind, we decided upon an app which helps gamers connect to other gamers during those times when no friends are online. 

## How Did We Develop This? 
1. We drew out a simple site design on Draw.io. Our plans were centered around Discord's theme and sidebar layout, with modifications such as top banners to draw attention to different page sections.
2. We created a brand image for our project, which helped us to fully envision our project and the scale at which it could sit.
3. We recreated these plans using Bootstrap Studio, aiming for a simple, accessible, responsive site.
4. We hosted our project on Heroku, which made updates easy and intuitive for Mike, who handled deployments.
5. We did a lot of testing and refactoring to make sure the many moving parts of our project worked together cohesively.

## Special Notes
As our first foray into web development, this was not a bad effort. It is our belief that our site functioned more reliably and more elegantly than most of the other submissions, but it is also important to mention that this was not a criterion for grading. Rather, we just wanted to submit as professional work as we could.
